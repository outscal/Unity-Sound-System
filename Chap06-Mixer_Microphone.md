# Audio Mixer

Unity provides an efficient tool that can be used to mix various audio sources, apply different effects and also perform mastering. Mastering is a form of audio post production, it can make the appearance of your game very appealing and soothing to hear. You can open the Audio Mixer from Window->Audio->Audio Mixer or Ctrl+8 which is the default hotkey.

You can give the name of your audio mixer in the first box. Basically, an audio mixer is an asset and you can have multiple mixers active at any time. There is always a Master group and then you can add different groups to define the structure of your mixer.

You can also capture the settings of all the parameters in a group as a snapshot and hence, transitioning between multiple snapshots can provide your game with various themes.

The final option, Views allow you to disable the visibility of certain groups within a mixer and set this as a view. This also helps you to make transition between different views as required by your game.
